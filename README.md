# Advent Of Code
My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/

My approach: no libraries, no frameworks, no magic, pure python. As much as possible, I try to solve the problem using only the tools provided by python. Some problems require external libraries, but I try to keep the dependencies to a minimum.
